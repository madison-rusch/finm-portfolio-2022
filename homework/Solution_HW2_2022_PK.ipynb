    "\n",
    "### (a) Using just the information in the case, what are two measures by which hedge funds are an attractive investment?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hedge Funds had better returns than the market and lower Volaitility (smoother returns) making them an attractive instrument ( the HFRI has a much higher SR than the S&P500 - .84 vs .41) . Hedge Funds provide diversification benefits. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower volatility ususally is because of lack of pricing of these illiquid or niche assets in the Hedge Fund\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) What are the main benefits of investing in hedge funds via an ETF instead of directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ETFs are liquid and are accesible to lower net worth individuals. Hedge funds have higher fee 2%-20%, where as ETFs have lower expense ratio as their fee. <br><br>\n",
    "- Furthermore, the investment does not have the idiosyncratic risk of a single fund, subject to that single fund's management, legal risks, etc. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, there are drawbacks to investing in the ETF instead of a single fund. Namely, the single fund may deliver excess returns (alpha) via specialized information, market access, skill, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "### (a) Explain as simply as possible how HFRI, MLFM, MLFM-ES, and HDG differ in their construction and purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HFRI** - Hedge fund Index Series. Index of surveyed hedge funds (2000 Holdings) designed to track the performance of the hedge market as a whole. Monthly returns based on surveys. This can't be launched as an ETF as they need a third party index as benchmark. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MLFM** - Index Series created by Merrill Lynch, to replicate the performance of HFRI. Its a linear factor decomposition of the HFRI returns into 6 assets. This is not an asset and not an ETF. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MLFM-ES** - MLFM exchange serires, similar to MLFM, but a benchmark to HDG and thus it contains liquid investable assets. It also makes one change in the factors, substituting  6- month Eurodollar deposit yields with US Treasury Bills. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HDG** - Actual tradaeble asset trying to track the MLFM-ES, by actually trading on these assets. HDG do not strictly adhere to MLFM-ES replication and would deviate from positions if they can get additional returns or reduce transaction cost. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) How well does the Merrill Lynch Factor Model (MLFM) track the HFRI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exhibit 1, slide 18 shows that MLFM to HFRI has a correlation of 0.90 through 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c) In which factor does the MLFM have the largest loading? (See a slide in Exhibit 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  By far, the largest factor loading is in t-bills. This is true throughout 2013 and 2014. See Exhibit 1, slides 19-20 for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (d) What are the main concerns you have for how the MLFM attempts to replicate the HFRI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The factors used in the MLFM are highly correlated, which raises concerns about the factor weights. Also, the dynamic regression used to construct the weights on the six factors was a backward-looking exercise, thus it will always lag behind the changes in hedge fund style.\n"

    "## 4.) The HDG Product\n",
    "\n",
    "### (a) What does ProShares ETF, HDG, attempt to track? Is the tracking error small?\n",
    "\n",
    "- HDG tracks MLFM-ES Index benchmark. The tracking error is low.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "-  HDG tracks a modified version of the ML Factor Model, MLFM-ES. The Merrill Lynch Factor Model involves indexes which cannot be exactly traded. For that reason, ProShares created a traded version of the Factor Model which replaces non-traded indexes with liquid, traded securities. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exhibit 1, slide 22 shows that this modified benchmark tracks the standard ML Factor Model with a correlation of 99.7% when looking at daily data from 2011-2013. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exhibit 2 shows that HDG tracks this benchmark closely, though it does not report a numerical estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (b) HDG is, by construction, delivering beta for investors. Isn't the point of hedge funds to generate alpha? Then why would HDG be valuable?\n",
    "\n",
    "- HDG may be valuable by delivering complicated or expensive beta to investors. In that sense, a sophisticated \"beta\" could be valued as \"alpha\" by investors, especially if delivered in a low-cost ETF. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- And even if HDG is delivering only accessible beta, it could be valuable to a portfolio through its ability to diversify against traditional equity and bond allocations, as shown in Exhibit 1 and discussed as a benefit of HFRI. And at ETF fees, this could be an efficient way of loading into these alternative exposures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (c) The fees of a typical hedge-fund are 2% on total assets plus 20% of excess returns if positive. HDG's expense ratio is roughly 1% on total assets. What would their respective net Sharpe Ratios be, assuming both have a gross excess returns of 10% and volatility of 20%?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The gross returns of the underlying assets have a Sharpe Ratio of 0.50. Net of the 1% fee, the net SR for the ETF would then be 9/20 = 0.45. Net of fees, the hedge-fund has 6% excess returns, which leads to a Sharpe Ratio of 6/20 = 0.30. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of course, this calculation is very simple, but it intends to illustrate that performance is sensitive to the high fees traditionally charged by hedge funds. In the numerical example above, the ETF delivers 90% of the asset-level Sharpe Ratio, while the Hedge Fund delivers 60% of the underlying asset Sharpe Ratio. Thus, though the ETF may miss some of the individual hedge-fund premia, it also has a lower hurdle rate given the lower fees."
