    "### 1 Short Answer\n",
    "#### 1.1 What is done in the construction of the value factor, HML, to reduce its correlation to MKT? SMB?\n",
    "The HML, or value factor, is constructed by going long value stocks, and shorting growth stocks. By only using a certain decile at the top and bottom of the scale, we are able to reduce correlation to both MKT (market factor), and SMB (size factor). Additionally, the values used to sort the scale of the value and size factors are relatively orthogonal to each other, which also reduces correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 The Value factor underperformed in the time since the DFA-case. What might DFA say in defense of value as a good investment, notwithstanding these statistics?\n",
    "The value factor (HML) is lowly correlated to the Market and Size factors, which makes it a good diversifier for DFA, in spite of its low returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 We found these tangency portfolio weights for the 4 factor model considered by AQR. What might we conclude from this about this “AQR” pricing model?\n",
    "We can see based on weighting of the factors that Market (MKT), Value (HML), and Momentum (UMD) factors are all roughly equal in importance in AQR's pricing model. However, the size factor (SMB) has such a low weighting in the tangency portfolio that it has very little impact in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 If the CAPM model worked perfectly, then the MKT factor would have the highest Sharpe ratio and highest Treynor ratio of all assets.\n",
    "True. If the CAPM worked perfectly, then the market portfolio would be the tangency portfolio, and would therefore have the highest Sharpe ratio (by definition of the tangency portfolio). Additionally, the Treynor Ratio would equal the market returns (because the beta would = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.5 What is the biggest difference in performance between long-only momentum and long-short momentum?\n",
    "Though in general we saw higher means in the long-only momentum, it was due to that fact that the long-only portfolio was highly correlated to the market. The long-short momentum portfolio was negatively correlated to the market factor, and was much more diversifying when combined with the other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6 Do you think we could operate an effective momentum strategy given just BTC? Explain and be specific.\n",
    "No. In order for a momentum strategy to be effective, it is required for there to be a large universe of assets to pick from, where we could take extreme winners and losers and construct a long-short portfolio. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.7 In the factor model using MKT, SMB, HML, UMD, (the “AQR model”,) which factors can the entire market have a positive net exposure, and which must the market must have net 0 exposure?\n",
    "The market is able to have positive net exposure for MKT, SMB, and UMD factors. However, not all investors can be exposed to the value (HML) factor, otherwise it would be reflected in the market premium. HML must therefore have net 0 exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.8 The APT says that a ”perfect” Linear Factor Decomposition (LFD) will work as a perfect Linear Factor Pricing Model (LFPM). What must the factors achieve as an LFD to meet the APT’s condition?\n",
    "In order to meet APT's condition, the LFD must have a \"perfect\" R-squared = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.9 Is it possible for a factor model to fit perfectly as an LFPM yet to fit imperfectly as an LFD?\n",
    "Yes. With Linear Factor Pricing Models, we are not trying to replicate portfolios. It's possible for our LFPM to have alphas of zeros, but an R-squared value less than one. This LFPM would therefore not be a perfect LFD, but would fit perfectly as an LFPM.\n"
